As the commercial use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) for tasks such as surveillance, maintenance, and goods delivery increases, it is expected that the density of urban air traffic will exceed the capacity of traditional human control centers. To ensure safety and efficiency, an automated unmanned approach to UAS traffic management (UTM) is required. \par

This project addresses this challenge by applying Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) strategies to the domain of autonomous urban airspace management. The primary aim was to evaluate different automated airspace management policies by developing a custom discrete-event simulation tool capable of modeling airspace service providers (ASPs) and processing dynamic flight plan requirements. \par
